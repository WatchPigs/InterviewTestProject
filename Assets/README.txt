FatalFox take home project
Unity Version: 2022.3.4f1

This project contains basic starting material for an FPS game.
You are provided:
- A player with basic movement 
- A basic sandbox scene to move around in
- A suite of basic weapons


Your goal is to create a weapons system that allows the player to swap between at least 3 weapons.
- The weapons should be visible in first person
- The player should be able to swap between the weapons easily
- Each of the weapons must have some functionality (If its a gun, make it shoot)

Don't spend too much time constructing this or adding too many features. 
You should only dedicate a couple of hours to completing this task.

Tips:
- This project is yours, if you want to change any of the code, feel free!
- Show us your brand of style and organization - file structure and naming conventions are up to you
- If you want to add packages to spice up the visuals, feel free! But only use the free stuff
- We are primarily going to look at system structure and code, so focus on the base system 


Have fun!
